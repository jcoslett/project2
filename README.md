Yet-to-Be-Named Education Company

The present project is a web application for a company that would provide courses, tutoring, and educational consulting to families new to the Los Angeles area from the People's Republic of China. The idea is to make a clear case for how its educators could realize a family's goals for their children, all while providing a genuine immersion into American culture.
